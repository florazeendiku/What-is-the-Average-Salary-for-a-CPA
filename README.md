<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that as of May 2019 (the most current data available), the median annual pay for accountants in the United States was $71,550. Accounting salaries ranged from less than $44,480 for the lowest 10% to more than $124,450 for the highest 10%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regrettably, there is no distinction made by <strong><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://mytaxteaminc.com/tax-preparation-services-dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tax preparation dallas</a></strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;between accountants who hold a CPA qualification and those who do not. Additionally, it does not distinguish between the diverse job titles that an accountant could keep and excludes revenue from self-employment. We have gathered the material below to aid you in making those distinctions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let's dissect each of the four categories above so you can use them appropriately for your situation.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li aria-level="1"><strong>Experience and CPA Salary: What It Means</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average starting pay for the<strong> <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://mytaxteaminc.com/professional-accounting-services-dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accounting services dallas</a></strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">is around $64,000, but depending on where you live and work, it can range from $44,000 to $84,500.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience begins to encompass real-time spent working in the industry, accomplishments that go along with the role(s) you've performed, and so on once you land your first position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in their careers, new accountants frequently go through the following stages:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>0&ndash;1 year (Accountant at Entry Level)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; Gaining your first year of experience is a significant achievement. You will learn a lot throughout this hectic period. You'll learn a lot, and you could begin to have a sense of the path you want to pursue your career in.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>One to three years (junior accountant)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You might anticipate gaining greater responsibility over the following years, especially in the areas where you demonstrate an interest or level of experience.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>4-6 years (Senior accountant)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - By this time, most accountants have decided on their professional path, and your work title will likely soon reflect your area of expertise.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>6+ years -</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The amount of years you've worked becomes less critical if you've held a senior position for a while in favor of more particular experience, such as your successes and awards. On the ladder, the highest position is not available to everyone.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li aria-level="1"><strong>What the Industry Does to CPA Salary</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing between public accounting and private accounting (sometimes known as "corporate" or "management" accounting) is the first significant choice a new accountant must make. A Certified Public Accountant can be found working in either field, despite what the title might suggest.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Salary for public accountants</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the average starting salary for a public accountant is $57,750.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Salary of a private accountant</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the average starting salary for a private accountant is $57,250.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li aria-level="1"><strong>How the Size of the Company Affects CPA Pay</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry and firm size both have an impact on CPA profits. Large businesses are prepared and willing to spend more to entice excellent personnel. The complexity of different accounting responsibilities increases with a company's size, assets, or number of clients served, and accountants' wages reflect this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other sources of remuneration are challenging to quantify in monetary terms, but they must be mentioned here anyway.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
    <li aria-level="1"><strong>The Effect of Location on CPA Salary</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, the median CPA compensation increases with the size of the city. You don't have to reside in New York or Chicago if you don't enjoy the weather and find major cities uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since accountants are often well paid, it is best first to identify a place to live or a company to work for before letting the changes in the table below guide your pay expectations.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Benefits of Becoming a CPA Outside of Pay</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CPA certificate can boost your overall earnings in addition to your prospective pay raise, and it offers several other advantages that can further your accounting career.</span></p>
